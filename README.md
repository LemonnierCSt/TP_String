# TP_String
 The aim of this practical is to implement a part of the standard class string.
 
## Targets
* Implement a class in C++
* Manage versioning with the using of Git
* Learn to code in group
* Introduction to valgrind 
* Manage gdb and the technique of debugging
* Conception of classes and attributes in group

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

None

### Installing
None

## Running the tests
There is a bunch of unitary tests made to check each method of our program. They are done in *main.cpp* .

The program runs by the *make* and *./main* commands in the terminal.


## Versioning
We used GitHub for versioning. A .git file is available with the history of all the commits and merge done by the members of the group.
